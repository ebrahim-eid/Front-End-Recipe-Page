## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

Buildin Recipe-Page for Front-End-Mentor 

## Where to find everything

You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized.

We also include variable and static font files for the required fonts for this project. 

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
